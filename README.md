# Titan City, 3023

# Story

A 2D game environment which is set in the rugged but habitable Titan, the largest moon of Saturn. The game follows a story where the protagonist explores Titan and completes various tasks in order to build his first house on the surface of Titan. The player can only move in x-axis (left or right).

On reaching the destination, i.e., Titan, the protagonist establishes communication. The system he uses to communicate back to Earth is a highly sophisticated, futuristic piece of equipment. Then, he sets up a refinery system to clear the golden atmosphere. This layer is now on a rugged planet in which habitability has been proven. The protagonist then builds the first livable house in the land of Titan. On finishing these tasks, he successfully builds Titan into a highly developed city.
